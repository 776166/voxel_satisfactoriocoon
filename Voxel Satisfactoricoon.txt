Production of firts item of Voxel Tycoon can be the game goal.
Need to make voxel models of most all objects.
Diesel engine/Tesla needes their own Truck/Wagon. Model of diesel engine itself can be taken from any game diesel engine. :)

Engine Assembler factory can be used to produce the ingame transport.

If you want to participate in this affaire, contact me. =)
I can balance it and make mod. You have to make/prepare models.
